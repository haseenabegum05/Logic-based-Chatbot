Rule-based Chatbot

Features
Predefined Rules: The chatbot's responses are determined by a set of predefined rules, ensuring consistent and accurate interactions.
Pattern Matching: The chatbot uses pattern matching techniques to identify keywords and user input, selecting the appropriate rule for generating responses.
Structured Conversations: Enjoy structured and guided conversations tailored to specific topics and tasks.
Quick Implementation: With fixed rules, this chatbot is quick to implement, making it ideal for specific applications and tasks.
